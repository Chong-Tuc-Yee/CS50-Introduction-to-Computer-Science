            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a passionate and hardworking engineer keen to join in <i><u>software developer/business analytics field.</u></i>
                I was a Materials Science & Engineering student from National University of Singapore.
                After graduation, I explored along the line of engineering field. My first job was an R&D engineer.
                But then, I realised that I don't like this field and I am very sure I don't want to stay in it for the next 5 or 10 years.
                That is when I decided I needed a change.
                Upon the realization, I started to explore other options and that is when I came upon software engineering field.
                I was introduced to this field by my friend who studied computer science. I gave it a try and took up courses online to upskill myself.
                The more I delve into the subject, I was fascinated by it, by what programming can do for us. How it can impact so much things even in various other fields like finance, healthcare industry etc.
                I believe that this is the path that I want to walk on and that will lead me to a greater future.
